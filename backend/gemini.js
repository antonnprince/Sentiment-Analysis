Other watches are just basic glorified heart rate monitors when doing strength exercises. Even ones that do boast \"track your reps\" just guestimate how many you did at the end.

They are accurate enough for health monitoring, they work with any smartphone and they have a very good battery life.\r\nI tried the Galaxy Watch 7 40mm and found that the heart rate sensor is so inaccurate that it is not really usable for health monitoring. Similarly, the blood pressure measurement is too imprecise. In the end, Garmin combines the best of both worlds: health tracking and connected features. Samsung excels in the connected watch aspect if the watch is paired with a Samsung smartphone only, but is really not up to date on the health monitoring aspect because of the inaccuracy of its biometric sensors and its too low battery life.",
